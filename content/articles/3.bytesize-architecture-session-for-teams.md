## Bytesize Architecture Sessions for teams

### Context

I have been part of teams following Scrums practices. A new requirement comes in. We refine the problem with the team,  debate the implementation in order to provide an estimation. During this exercise, a lot of key insights are generated. The people most comfortable with the problem and the current system behavior share what they know to the others. The motivated person to take on the task will ask questions, hoping to have the necessary understanding to start implementing the task. The ticket is detailed with the questions and answers, the links to the components to update and the tests to verify. In my experience, some information are often lost after the meeting is over.

<!-- Most of the time in my experience, questions rise during the development of the task. The person responsible of the task discovers edge cases, raise design questions and improvements. Follows a suite of exchange with the rest of the team, until the questions are answered and consensus reached. -->

In our team, we work differently. Requirements come and are refined asynchronously (see [Asynchronous Backlog Grooming](https://backstage.payfit.com/asynchronous-backlog-grooming/), minus the bots), until we're confident enough to start the task together. When a change in system's behavior is important, we organize a Bytesize Architecture Session to design it together. This provides a shared diagram of the impacted components, annotated with every questions we may still have, as well as key decisions we made.

## Changing our core product capability

I work for a payroll editor and lately, we worked on revamping the payslip generation capability of our product. A payslip is a PDF binary we generate from the payroll variables. During the month, customer can preview their payslips according to any input they declare. During payroll closing, we generate a final legal version, available to employees. This code was part of one monolithic and legacy service. It took us several months to extract, in a lot of small steps. One step in particular was debated: how should we generate from now on payslips during closing?

To discuss a solution, we planned a session of 1h30 on Miro, using this [C4 Model template](https://miro.com/miroverse/c4-model-getting-started-workshop/). We were 4 engineers at this session: 3 members of my team, and one member of the payroll computation team, formerly owning this payslip generation and handing it over to us. This persons worked tremendously on the past months to design the interface and the testing plan to enable this migration. We paired several times to move bit by bit the code. I was the second most expert of the topic in the call.

### Setting up the goal

We always start from the context diagram from C4 Model: the higher level, showing the personas and their interactions with the system. In this user story, when a payroll administrator requests to close their payroll, then after a few seconds or minutes, employees are notified of a new payslip available they can access on their personal employee space. In case of one error with one payslip for a company, we don't publish any payslip to employees.

We discussed the scope of the exercise for 5-10 minutes. We always try to define the boundaries of the change. This time, we mostly refreshed everyone mental model, having participant with less affinity with the migration, as well as reminding we are not changing anything from the users' point of view. The behavior remains the same. The change is purely technical, on the live system, without downtime.

### Alone together

During 8 minutes, we drew in each corner everyone mental model of the change they would do. We are not yet master in C4 modelling. The important part of the exercise is to convey an opinion. To draw quickly the components we need, we added to the board a legend and toolbox participants can reuse.

We all had something to share, more or less detailed, depending on the degree of familiarity, but all were theoretically working solution. One by one, we presented our diagrams and asking questions about meaning of some dependencies.

### Consensus

During 35 minutes, we discussed how we would implement it. In this session, the major part of the feature implementation quickly reached consensus. We all had similar solutions, while discarding alternatives approach. In our context, an event driven approach would create difficulties to handle errors, and our user interface is not ready for showing a progress bar with the number of payslips being generated. That's something we plan for later.

I took the pen to draw. We started from the frontend, while the other participants were telling what to pick, copy/pasting me boxes from their diagram or re-creating from scratch.

We have today a process manager doing the orchestration of the payroll closing steps. It would be in charge to loop over every employees to generate a payslip. We create batches of _X_ payslip generation at a time, knowing most of our customers have less than _X_ employees. If a batch fail, the process manager halts the execution.

The debate in our case went in length about release strategy. How do we change a working system with one that is supposed to do the same? We took an approach of a feature flag to enable the behavior progressively, and rollout in case of unknown unknown. Our diagram was showing were the feature would be enabled or not. We work in a distributed system and feature flag updates may take time to rollout, thus we had to detail how to cope with overlapping execution between the old and the new system.

We listed few tasks for later:

- when can we deprovision the legacy service?
- what metrics should we look into on this new flow?
- what name for our feature flag?

We took the time to document properly on the stop, discussing labels and descriptions.

### Session summary

The summary in our case was quick, having a quickly reached consensus. At this point, we had a clear understanding of the implementation, a documentation diagram to support it and a plan everyone agreed on.

### Mobbing

With the momentum and the knowledge we accumulated, we found super efficient after a session, to start with the implementation. This requires a break after the brainstorming session. People were keen on starting development and get rid of the task. After an hour, we were reaching the end of the day. A major part of the code was tested and implemented. Only was left details regarding environment and feature flag configuration, that one person could continue the day after, providing pull requests to the others to approve the completion of the task.

## Conclusion

We may sometimes work on small isolated tasks (maintenance, investigation, etc). We are not always there all the time neither. We found in Bytesize Architecture Sessions a powerful way to keep people up to date on particular topic. Given a complex task at hand, which changes a lot the system and its technical behavior, using a session to then kick start a mob programming session helped in sharing knowledge, and having everyone contributing to the problem at hand.
