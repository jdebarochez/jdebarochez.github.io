The process review, and fool proofing is often light. We often find a dedicated author and a lack of shared ownership among a team. When the author leaves, a handover may be done, yet again often a light process. Documentation may be reviewed upon completion, it does not follow the same care as the code it reflects. In the recent years, we found an increase toward documentation as code tools (Structurizr, OpenAPI specifications). These greatly helps in having different views over the code. The closer the documentation is to the code, the more consistent it stays. On the other hand, documentation manually written in a Notion, rarely survive the passage of time. Architecture diagrams often fall short over the iterations, refactoring and evolutions."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"When discussing with peers, I often draw my mental model of a high level architecture diagram on the fly, specifically for the context we are in, ignoring existing diagrams, which serve a different purpose, yet represent the same components.
